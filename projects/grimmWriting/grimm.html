                            My original goal was to use a corpus of fictional stories with machine learning that the user could interact or “chat" with. 
                            As I started researching more about machine learning, this project turned into an <b>exploration of “creativity."</b>

                            Both were helpful in driving what I wanted the final interface to look like, but I decided that I had to use machine learning in order to actually function in the way I wanted.

                            To conceptualize my underlying questions regarding creativity and machine learning, I used Firebase to store user inputs to be visualized at the end of each user experience.
                            <br><br>
                            I decided on using charRNN from ml5.js since it was beginner friendly and I was able to find a lot of easy-to-understand examples.
                            A big thank you to Julie Lizardo for help in training the model!
                            <br><br>
                            Following ml5 documentation, I was able to use the model with my past ideas and created: 
                            <b>a “chatbot" </b>
                            that came up with 
                            <b>new text based on user input</b>
                            and 
                            <b>stored that input.</b>
                            With each new user, 
                            <b>previous users' inputs would be recalled</b>
                             and compared against.
                             <br><br>
                             Essentially, users would co-create a story with the chatbot and see how similar their story was to previous stories also made with the chatbot.
